### `Instructions`
- The Breadcrumb isn't working properly because this is a SPA. If you click in one of the links the aplication will crash;
- The Dropdown Menu works, but you need first to "logon" a new user in the form. After filling it, press Save and reload the page. So you will see the name of the new user and its initials. Always you add a new user logged on or not it is needed to reload the page;
- The filter field is working properly;
- The "trash" icon in the table is working properly;
- The links in addresses and e-mails aren't working properly;
- The logout button in the Dropdown Menu is working properly
